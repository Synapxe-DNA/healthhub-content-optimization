      "Breast Cancer Screening\n",
      "Beyond the recommended monthly breast self-examinations, the best way to protect yourself from breast cancer is to go for regular mammograms. A mammogram can detect tiny lumps that cannot be felt by the hand. Early detection, followed by treatment and good control of the condition can result in better chances of surviving this cancer, lowering the risk of serious complications.\n",
      "Women who are 50 years old and above are recommended to go for a mammogram once every two years. Women 40 to 49, can screen for breast cancer, annually, provided their doctor has discussed the benefits and limitations with them. It is important to make an informed choice about going for screening.\n",

You can protect yourself by taking active preventive measures to protect yourself against them. Besides being well informed about these conditions, you can protect yourself by going for regular health screenings.\\nBreast Cancer Screening\\n\\nBeyond the recommended monthly breast self-examinations, the best way to protect yourself from breast cancer is to go for regular mammograms. A mammogram can detect tiny lumps that cannot be felt by the hand. Early detection, followed by treatment and good control of the condition can result in better chances of surviving this cancer, lowering the risk of serious complications.\\nWomen who are 50 years old and above are recommended to go for a mammogram once every two years. Women 40 to 49, can screen for breast cancer, annually, provided their doctor has discussed the benefits and limitations with them. It is important to make an informed choice about going for screening.\\nRelated:\\nCancer Facts You Cannot Ignore\\n\\nCancer Facts You Cannot Ignore: https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/cancer-facts-you-cannot-ignore\\n\\nSubsidy for Mammograms\\n\\nUnder the Health Promotion Boards (HPB)\\nScreen for Life (SFL)[1], women aged 50 years and above can benefit from subsidised mammogram screenings which cost $50 for Singapore citizens, $75 for Permanent Residents (PRs), $37.50 for Merdeka Generation Cardholders and $25 for Pioneer Generation Cardholders at participating locations.\\n\\nScreen for Life: https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/Screen_for_Life\\n[1]: #footnoteone\\n\\nEligibility for subsidised mammograms under HPBs Screen for Life is as follows:\\n  - Singapore citizen or PR\\n  - Has not gone for a screening mammogram in the last 24 months\\n  - Has no breast symptoms like lumps or bloodstained nipple discharge\\n  - Has not been breastfeeding for the past six months\\n  - 50 years old and above\\n[1]Screen for Life refers to HPBs screening programmes for cardiovascular diseases and selected cancers.

Early detection, followed by treatment and good control of the condition can result in better chances of surviving this cancer, lowering the risk of serious complications.\n",

Women 40 to 49, can screen for breast cancer, annually, provided their doctor has discussed the benefits and limitations with them.
