## Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> At this point, it is assumed that `poetry` has been installed on your device.

Navigate to this directory and enter into a poetry shell.

```bash

Poetry is used to start the backend server. Currently, there is only one command that can start the server.

```bash
poetry run dev
```
