THESE ARE THE KEYPOINTS FOR ARTICLE 1


 Main keypoint: Quit Smoking: Stubbing Out the Myths
 Content: You're convinced of the health benefits and that quitting's the right way to go, but you're not sure if you can make it. Or you may want to know what happens after you stop smoking before you set a quit date. We're here to help! This week, we bust some myths that may have been causing you to have second thoughts about stubbing out.

 Main keypoint: When Trying to Quit Smoking...

 Sub keypoint: Myth #1: Its too late to quit, the damage is done.
 Content: Not true! Its never too late to quit smoking. Whether youve smoked for decades or months, and no matter your age, quitting will improve your health and decrease your risks of developing certain diseases. Will your body heal after you quit? Yes! In fact, youll feel better just eight hours after you put out your last cigarette, as the carbon monoxide level and oxygen level in your blood return to normal. And within two short days, your risk of a heart attack is reduced. Within three months of being smoke-free, your blood pressure returns to normal.

 Sub keypoint: Myth #2: I can escape the risks by smoking less.
 Content: Will cutting down on the number of cigarettes you smoke help prevent diseases like diabetes and lung cancer? No. There is no safe amount of exposure to cigarette smoking one cigarette is still one too many. If you are thinking of reducing the number of cigarettes you smoke, make it a goal to gradually work towards zero!

 Sub keypoint: Myth #3: Failing to quit once means youll never succeed.
 Content: Not true! Most smokers take more than six attempts to quit successfully and stay smoke-free, so dont give up! Treat your attempts as practice rounds and learn from what went wrong. Then use this knowledge to give it another try. You can also look for nicotine replacement therapy products to help increase your chances of quitting successfully.

 Main keypoint: What Will Happen After You Quit Smoking?

 Sub keypoint: Myth #4: Quitting will cause me to be moody and irritable.
 Content: True, quitting could cause us to experience withdrawal symptoms like moodiness and irritability. Don't worry, they're normal signs that your body is recovering from the harmful effects of smoking, and they last only a short while. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms are usually worse in the first week, and they often disappear after the first two to three weeks when the feeling of wellbeing starts to kick in. If you find that your withdrawal symptoms unbearable, consider tapping onto nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) which increases the chances of quitting by easing these withdrawal symptoms.

 Sub keypoint: Myth #5: I will gain weight after quitting.
 Content: Not everyone will gain weight after stubbing out, so dont fret too much about gaining a spare tire in the long term. The reason some of us might put on weight is that our sense of taste and smell recovers after we quit smoking, so food might seem yummier and we might eat more than usual. Still concerned? You can do something to prevent weight gain after quitting, for example, by eating healthier and moving more.

 Main keypoint: Resources for Quitting
 Content: Join the I Quit Programme and remain smoke free for 28 days and you are 5 times more likely to quit smoking. You can nominate your loved ones as a supporter when you sign up for the programme. Validate your smoke-free status and redeem a HPB eVoucher* worth $50 at the 28th day milestone. Keep going and you'll also receive eVouchers* worth $30 and $20 at the 3rd month and 6th month milestone respectively!

### Quit Smoking: Stubbing Out the Myths

Hey there! If you’re thinking about quitting smoking, you’re already on the right path. It’s completely normal to have a few doubts or worries about the journey ahead. You might be curious about what happens after you stub out that last cigarette, and that's totally okay! This week, we’re here to bust some myths that might be holding you back from taking that important step.

### When Trying to Quit Smoking...

#### Myth #1: It’s too late to quit; the damage is done.

Let’s clear this up right away: it’s never too late to quit smoking! Whether you’ve been puffing away for years or just a few months, quitting can significantly boost your health and lower your chances of developing serious diseases. You might be wondering if your body will bounce back after quitting. Absolutely! In just eight hours after your last smoke, your carbon monoxide levels will drop, and your oxygen levels will start to normalise. Just two days in, your heart attack risk begins to decrease, and within three months, your blood pressure could be back to normal. How amazing is that?

#### Myth #2: I can escape the risks by smoking less.

Thinking that smoking fewer cigarettes will keep you safe? Think again! There’s no safe level of smoking; even one cigarette can be harmful. If you’re considering cutting down, aim for a total smoke-free life instead. You’ve got this!

#### Myth #3: Failing to quit once means you’ll never succeed.

Not true at all! Most folks who quit smoking have to try multiple times before they finally kick the habit for good. So, don’t be discouraged! Each attempt is a learning experience. Just treat it as practice, figure out what didn’t work, and give it another shot. Also, consider exploring nicotine replacement therapy options to boost your chances of success.

### What Will Happen After You Quit Smoking?

#### Myth #4: Quitting will make me moody and irritable.

Yes, it’s true that you might feel a bit moody or irritable when you quit, but don’t sweat it! These withdrawal symptoms are perfectly normal and a sign that your body is healing. They usually peak during the first week and start to fade after two to three weeks, making way for a much better feeling. If you’re finding it tough, think about using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to help ease those symptoms.

#### Myth #5: I will gain weight after quitting.

Not everyone puts on weight after quitting, so relax a bit about that. Some people might notice a change because their taste and smell improve, making food a little more tempting. If you’re worried about weight gain, focus on eating healthier and getting a bit more active. You’ve got the power to manage this!

### Resources for Quitting

Ready to take the plunge? Join the I Quit Programme! If you stay smoke-free for 28 days, you’ll be five times more likely to quit for good. You can even bring a loved one on board as your supporter when you sign up. Plus, when you hit that 28-day milestone, you can validate your smoke-free status and snag a HPB eVoucher worth $50! Keep going, and you’ll also earn eVouchers of $30 and $20 at the three-month and six-month milestones, respectively. 

### Next Steps

You’re taking an incredible step towards a healthier you! Remember, it’s okay to seek support and lean on resources like the I Quit Programme. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, take a moment for yourself, breathe, and remind yourself of the amazing benefits of quitting. You’ve got this!
