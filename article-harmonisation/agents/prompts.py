                        If a header has a parent header, the header will be labelled as "Sub keypoint".
                        You may come up with a relevant header for additional content and label it as a "Main keypoint".
                        Not all sentences are relevant to its header. If a sentence is irrelevant to all headers, you can place it under the last header "Omitted sentences" at the end of the article.

                Do NOT paraphrase and strictly only add or remove sentences.
                You may use bullet points, but do NOT paraphrase the sentences
                Remove ALL sentences under the "Omitted Sentences" section when compiling the information.

                You may add conjuctions and connectors between sentences if it improves the flow of the sentences.

                            Example: We recommend taking the diabetes medicine as prescribed by your doctor or pharmacist. This will help in the medicine’s effectiveness and reduce the risk of side effects.

                        3. Provide reassurance
                            Your writing should reassure readers that the situation is not a lost cause.
                            Example: Type 1 diabetes can develop due to factors beyond your control. However, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes can be prevented by having a healthier diet, increasing physical activity, and losing weight.

                        You should write your content based on the required sections step by step.
                        After each section has been rewritten, you must check your writing with each guideline step by step.

                        Here is an example you should use to structure your writing:
                            ### Start of example
                                1. Overview of Influenza
                                Influenza is a contagious viral disease that can affect anyone. It spreads when a person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. The virus is airborne and infects people when they breathe it in. Influenza, commonly known as the flu, can cause significant discomfort and disruption to daily life. It typically occurs in seasonal outbreaks and can vary in severity from mild to severe.

                                2. Causes and Risk Factors
                                Influenza is caused by the flu virus, which is responsible for seasonal outbreaks and epidemics. The flu virus is classified into three main types: A, B, and C. Types A and B are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics, while Type C causes milder respiratory illness. Factors that increase the risk of contracting influenza include close contact with infected individuals, a weakened immune system, and lack of vaccination. Additionally, those living in crowded conditions or traveling frequently may also be at higher risk.

                                3. Symptoms and Signs
                                Some symptoms include: High fever, cough, headache, and muscle aches. Other symptoms include sneezing, nasal discharge, and loss of appetite. Influenza symptoms can develop suddenly and may be accompanied by chills, fatigue, and sore throat. Some individuals may also experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea, although these are more common in children.

                                4. Complications of Influenza
                                The following people are at greater risk of influenza-related complications:
                                - Persons aged 65 years old and above.
                                - Children aged between 6 months old to 5 years old.
                                - Persons with chronic disorders of their lungs, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
                                - Women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Complications can include pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinus infections. In severe cases, influenza can lead to hospitalisation or even death, particularly in vulnerable populations.

                                5. Treatment and Prevention
                                Here are some ways to battle influenza and to avoid it:
                                Treatment: You can visit the local pharmacist to procure some flu medicine. Antiviral medications can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms if taken early. Over-the-counter medications can alleviate symptoms such as fever and body aches.
                                Prevention: Avoid crowded areas and wear a mask to reduce the risk of transmission. Hand hygiene is crucial; wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer. Getting an annual flu vaccine is one of the most effective ways to prevent influenza. The vaccine is updated each year to match the circulating strains.
                                Treatment: Rest at home while avoiding strenuous activities until your symptoms subside. Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet to support your immune system. Over-the-counter medications can provide symptomatic relief, but it is important to consult a healthcare provider for appropriate treatment options.

                                6. When to See a Doctor
                                You should visit your local doctor if your symptoms persist for more than 3 days, or when you see fit. Seek medical attention if you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, severe weakness, or high fever that does not respond to medication. Prompt medical evaluation is crucial for those at higher risk of complications or if symptoms worsen.

                        - In this section, your writing should be a brief explanation of the disease. You can assume that your readers have no prior knowledge of the condition.
                    2. Causes and Risk Factors
                    3. Symptoms and Signs
                        In this section, you MUST:
                            - You must list out the symptoms and signs in bullet points form.
                            - You should include a brief explanation before the bullet points in this section.

                2. Carry a positive tone
                    Do NOT convey negative sentiments in your writing.
                    You should communicate in a firm but sensitive way, focusing on the positives of a certain medication instead of the potential risks.
                    Example: We recommend taking the diabetes medicine as prescribed by your doctor or pharmacist. This will help in the medicine’s effectiveness and reduce the risk of side effects.

                3. Provide reassurance
                    Your writing should reassure readers that the situation is not a lost cause
                    Example: Type 1 diabetes can develop due to factors beyond your control. However, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes can be prevented by having a healthier diet, increasing physical activity, and losing weight.

                4. Break up lengthy sentences
                    You should break up long paragraphs into concise sections or bullet points.
                    You should also avoid lengthy, wordy bullet points.
                    Example: Mothers may unintentionally pass infectious diseases to their babies:
                        • The placenta during pregnancy
                        • Germs in the vagina during birth
                        • Breast milk after birth
                        As different viruses spread through different channels, pregnant women should seek their doctor’s advice regarding necessary screening to protect their baby.

                You should out your content based on the required sections step by step.
                After each section has been rewritten, you must check your writing with each guideline step by step.

                Here is an example you should use to structure your writing:
                    ### Start of example
                        1. Overview of Influenza
                        Influenza is a contagious viral disease that can affect anyone. It spreads when a person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. The virus is airborne and infects people when they breathe it in. Influenza, commonly known as the flu, can cause significant discomfort and disruption to daily life. It typically occurs in seasonal outbreaks and can vary in severity from mild to severe.

                        2. Causes and Risk Factors
                        Influenza is caused by the flu virus, which is responsible for seasonal outbreaks and epidemics. The flu virus is classified into three main types: A, B, and C. Types A and B are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics, while Type C causes milder respiratory illness. Factors that increase the risk of contracting influenza include close contact with infected individuals, weakened immune system, and lack of vaccination. Additionally, those living in crowded conditions or traveling frequently may also be at higher risk.

                        3. Symptoms and Signs
                        Some symptoms include: High fever, cough, headache, and muscle aches. Other symptoms include sneezing, nasal discharge, and loss of appetite. Influenza symptoms can develop suddenly and may be accompanied by chills, fatigue, and sore throat. Some individuals may also experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, although these are more common in children.

                        4. Complications of Influenza
                        The following people are at greater risk of influenza-related complications:
                        - Persons aged 65 years old and above.
                        - Children aged between 6 months old to 5 years old.
                        - Persons with chronic disorders of their lungs, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
                        - Women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Complications can include pneumonia, bronchitis, and sinus infections. In severe cases, influenza can lead to hospitalization or even death, particularly in vulnerable populations.

                        5. Treatment and Prevention
                        Here are some ways to battle influenza and to avoid it:
                        Treatment: You can visit the local pharmacist to procure some flu medicine. Antiviral medications can help reduce the severity and duration of symptoms if taken early. Over-the-counter medications can alleviate symptoms such as fever and body aches.
                        Prevention: Avoid crowded areas and wear a mask to reduce the risk of transmission. Hand hygiene is crucial; wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use hand sanitizer. Getting an annual flu vaccine is one of the most effective ways to prevent influenza. The vaccine is updated each year to match the circulating strains.
                        Treatment: Rest at home while avoiding strenuous activities until your symptoms subside. Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet to support your immune system. Over-the-counter medications can provide symptomatic relief, but it is important to consult a healthcare provider for appropriate treatment options.

                        6. When to See a Doctor
                        You should visit your local doctor if your symptoms persist for more than 3 days, or when you see fit. Seek medical attention if you experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, severe weakness, or high fever that does not respond to medication. Prompt medical evaluation is crucial for those at higher risk of complications or if symptoms worsen.

                1. Overview of the condition
                    - In this section, your writing should be a brief explanation of the disease. You can assume that your readers have no prior knowledge of the condition.
                2. Causes and Risk Factors
                3. Symptoms and Signs
                    In this section, you must:
                        - You must list out the symptoms and signs in bullet points form.

                4. Complications
                5. Treatment and Prevention
                6. When to see a doctor

            1. Carry a positive tone
                Do NOT convey negative sentiments in your writing.
                You should communicate in a firm but sensitive way, focusing on the positives of a certain medication instead of the potential risks.
                Example: We recommend taking the diabetes medicine as prescribed by your doctor or pharmacist. This will help in the medicine’s effectiveness and reduce the risk of side effects.

            2. Provide reassurance
                Your writing should reassure readers that the situation is not a lost cause
                Example: Type 1 diabetes can develop due to factors beyond your control. However, it can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes and medication. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes can be prevented by having a healthier diet, increasing physical activity, and losing weight.

            3. Break up lengthy sentences
                You should break up long paragraphs into concise sections.
                Example: Mothers may unintentionally pass infectious diseases to their babies:
                    • The placenta during pregnancy
                    • Germs in the vagina during birth
                    • Breast milk after birth
                As different viruses spread through different channels, pregnant women should seek their doctor’s advice regarding necessary screening to protect their baby.

            You should out your content based on the required sections step by step.
            After each section has been rewritten, you must check your writing with each guideline step by step.
