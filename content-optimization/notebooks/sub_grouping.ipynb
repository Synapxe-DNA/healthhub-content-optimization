       "      <td>As you may know, World AIDS Day is not only about learning more about HIV/AIDS; it's also about doing your part to help people living with HIV or AIDS.\\nWhether you're a relative, a friend, a volunteer, or just a helpful person, there are a few things that can be done to foster acceptance for people living with HIV/AIDS.\\nAs you'll see, being informed is one thing, but contributing to stigma, discrimination, and rejection is something else!\\nThat's why we thought it'd be helpful to give you some tips on how best to support the various initiatives for advocacy, empowerment, and education.\\nOh, and remember that support can take many forms, so don't worry if some of these tips may seem too small or too big for you!\\nWhat matters is that you're involved!\\n\\n1. Social Support for People Living with HIV\\nMisinformation on how HIV/AIDS is transmitted may make some people fearful of interacting with them, a situation that may isolate them in their time of need!\\nThe presence of informed, non-judgemental, and reliable support systems has proven successful in helping people lead a normal life.\\nMost importantly, positive social support can contribute to improved living conditions, as stress can affect how the body reacts to treatments.\\n\\n2. Emotional Support\\nWhether they're feeling happy, sad, angry, or just doubtful, some people need to voice their emotions or have someone to listen to them.\\nIf you think you can be helpful and someone living with HIV/AIDS reaches out to you, be that special someone they confide in and talk to.\\nDont be afraid to ask how your friend is feeling! Avoiding the issue is never the answer, especially where health matters are concerned.\\nYour interest and support can help people feel less self-conscious or less embarrassed.\\n\\n3. Support with Treatments\\nAs you know, the medical treatment of HIV/AIDS has been making pretty big strides over the years.\\nHaving open discussions about the medical treatments can help people living with HIV/AIDS to normalise their treatment as part of their daily routine and not feel stigmatised for it.\\nIf you're close to the person and you know he/she is forgetful, figure out how you can help him/her manage medications and medical appointments!\\nSometimes the most helpful thing you can do is keep things simple and practical!\\n\\n4. Empowering Methods\\nOne form of empowerment you can contribute to is education and advocacy.\\nBy educating those around us on HIV/AIDS through formal or informal platforms, this can help to address misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, and reduce stigma towards HIV/AIDS.\\nCreating a supportive environment can be of big help for people living with HIV/AIDS!\\nYou can involve your teachers, parents, and even the community to find out more about the condition, its symptoms, and its prevention.\\nRemember - every little bit counts!</td>\n",

       "      <td>https://www.healthhub.sg/live-healthy/Child-fractures</td>\n",
       "      <td>What is a Fracture?\\nFractures are breaks, cracks, or chips in a bone. Children commonly sustain limb fractures after trauma e.g. a fall from the monkey bars at the playground, during a soccer game or a road traffic accident. Fractures may occur in any bone of the body but upper limb fractures are the most common.\\n\\nHow Do You Know if Its Fractured?\\nIf your child has a fracture, your child may complain of pain and you may notice swelling at the site of injury. The limb with the fractured bone may also appear swollen or deformed. Your child may have difficulty moving the affected limb. If this is a bone in the lower limbs, your child may have difficulty weight-bearing / standing. Children's bones are often more pliable and they may sustain partial fractures through the bone shaft. These partial fractures are called greenstick fractures and can only be diagnosed with an X-ray.\\nFractures in infants or toddlers can be more difficult to detect. They may cry and not use the affected limb, despite there being no obvious sign of injury.\\nIf you are not sure if your child has sustained a fracture, it is advisable to see a doctor and obtain an X-ray of the affected area. An x-ray is recommended prior to massage or manipulation which can worsen the fracture (e.g. by a Chinese physician or Sinseh).\\nRelated: Children's Hand Conditions And Injuries\\n\\nWhat To Do if You Suspect a Fracture\\nDo not move a child whose injury involves the neck or back, unless he or she is in imminent danger. Movement can cause serious nerve damage. Call 995 for an ambulance. If the child must be moved, the neck and back must be completely immobilised first, ideally with at least one other person assisting you. Keeping the head, neck, and back in alignment, move the child together as a unit.\\nRelated: Preventing Falls for Babies and Toddlers\\nIf you suspect your child has a mild fracture of the arm, wrist or hand, make a sling to support the fractured area:\\n1. Find a large piece of cloth and fold it into the shape of a triangle.\\n2. Gently slide the wide part of the triangle under the injured arm.\\n3. Tie the loose ends around the neck. Make sure the sling is tied tight enough to hold the arm snugly but not so tightly that blood flow is restricted.\\n4. If a bone in the forearm or wrist is fractured, gently support the injured area and place the lower arm on a folded newspaper or magazine padded with a towel or pillow. This creates a splint that immobilises and protects the broken bone.\\n5. Tie the splint around the arm using cloth strips; place the strips on either side of the injured area.\\n6. After securing the splint, make a sling to support the arm.\\n7. See a doctor immediately to check for possible damage to the nerves or blood vessels. Your child may also need a cast of the fractured bone.\\n8. Give your child some pain relief if required (e.g. paracetamol) - please consult your doctor for the right dosage for your child.\\n\\nRead these next:\\n- Ankle conditions\\n- Common Childhood Injuries A Child-Safe Home\\n- The ABCs of Bruising in Children</td>\n",

       "      <td>Redefine and Reinvent Guys Night Out\\nAccording to the National Population Health Survey, the proportion of Singapore residents who engaged in sufficient total physical activity was 74.9% in 2022, significantly lower than the 76.4% in 2020, 80.1% in 2019 and 80.9% in 2017.\\nWhile Covid has disrupted our lifestyle, it is an opportunity for us to revaluate the importance of shaping an active lifestyle to preserve the quality of our health and well-being! Physical inactivity leads to an array of chronic lifestyle diseases. Nothing pleasant awaits overweight men - they're more likely to suffer from diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and many other medical conditions.\\nIf you are not keen on being the one in two males that are overweight, next time it is guy's night out and the plan is wings, pizza and beer, flex your persuasion muscles. Suggest to your bros something active instead. You could enthuse about the benefits of exercise\\nand good dietary habits, play the wife card and pin all your healthy motivations on her, or simply say: \"This uncle wants to be a hunkle!\". For those of us who are new to the lingo, an Uncle is the \"horrible result when you lepak\\ntoo much without exercising or watching your diet\" and a Hunkle is \"what you could be when you shape up to a healthier version of your body shape\".\\nWhatever works! What's most important is that you switch some of those greasy bro nights responsible for weight gain for uncle-to-hunkle activities. Pitch your bros to have a go at one of these 30 activities. At least one of them should get some love. Aim for at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week!\\n\\nGet Active Together\\n\\nNight-Time Outdoor Activities\\nNight cycle to Gardens by the Bay.\\nIts Friday night. Skip the drinks. Gather your gear and bros at East Coast and cycle down the entire stretch to Gardens by the Bay. As you shift your focus from work to peddling, let the cool night breeze whisk away your worries and lift your mood. If the night is still young, hydrate with veggie juice at Satay by the Bay and head towards Marina Bay Sands. Burn off even more calories cycling around the Promontory while enjoying the calm, serene Singapore River nightscape.\\nNight run at Labrador Park.\\nNot into cycling? How about a run at Labrador Park instead? Its much cooler at night which makes running feel a lot easier. Labrador Nature Reserve is one of the four protected nature reserves in Singapore. The park features a 3km running trail that passes through the Dragons Teeth Gate and a 6-inch cannon protecting the old fort. There are look-out decks at Berlayer Creek overlooking serene mangroves where you and your bros can cool down after the run.\\nGo for an after-hours group run.\\nRunning is a great way to clock the recommended minimum 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity a week. Form a running group with your kakis, that will give you company during your runs.\\nPlay laser tag at night.\\nIf cycling or running is too serious for you and your best buds on a Friday night, hop into your time machine and set the dial to childhood days. Immerse yourselves in a game of laser tag. Play cops and robbers or red team vs. blue team just like you used to do when you were kids. Plenty of places close late. There are also 24-hour joints. Scampering around shooting and dodging will get your heart racing and get a good workout in.\\n\\nDay-Time Outdoor Activities\\nHike at MacRitchie Reservoir Park.\\nMix things up a little. Suggest getting together in the day for a hike at MacRitchie Reservoir instead. Pretend that youre back in secondary school participating in the annual cross-country race with your kakis. Challenge each other and see who gets to finish first, or just take your time to enjoy the amazing biodiversity and stunning views from the TreeTop Walk.\\nShoot at Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.\\nAre you and your bros into gadgets? Pick up photography and head to Singapores first ASEAN Heritage Park. The Park is every nature photographers dream come true. Shutterbugs can trek through the many trails in this nature reserve and capture flora and fauna spring to life in every shot with your digital camera or smartphone. Test your gadgets and photography skills with your bros and see who shot it best!\\nFly a drone.\\nPrefer aerial photography? Drones might be the better way to bond while building up your brawn. Before you go piloting your drones, take note of the dos and donts by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. Make sure the drone stays within your line of sight to use this opportunity to increase your step count by walking and following your drone. Hitting your goal of 10,000 steps a day will be a breeze as a drone pilot.\\n\\nWeekend Outdoor Activities\\nPlay team sports.\\nLove team games like football, floorball and ultimate frisbee but have a hard time getting players? Form a team with your bros and play against other teams just like the good ol days. Join a team so that there will be sufficient players to participate in the games!\\nHit the beach.\\nCant get enough of your bros? Turn guys night out into a full-blown, full-day beach event. Play a round of beach volleyball, a game of frisbee, and take a quick dip in the sea. The fun things you and your kakis can do at the beach are endless. A full day out may be just what all of you need to get some exercise in while having fun.\\nRide the waves.\\nAfter spending days out at the beach, youve fallen in love with water sports. You are not alone. Singapores relatively tranquil waters isnt the perfect setting for aspiring surfers to show off a trick or two but fret not. Mens ingenuity and love for water sports is the reason for Wave House Sentosa - a place where you and your surfer bros can test the waters (and the waves). Work those core muscles to stay in balance and see whos the last bro standing.\\n\\nIndoor Activities\\nNot all bros are into the outdoors. We get that. Sometimes we are in the mood to stay indoors, especially when it gets too hot. Then there are rainy days. Wondering where to go in Singapore for some indoor bro-time that will still get you from uncle-to-hunkle? Here are some activities that are fun and, at the same time, will burn some cals.\\nBreak out from an escape room.\\nIts bros night out - the night you can stay out really late and its raining which makes it perfect for escape room! Bring out the Sherlock in you and the Watson in your best buds as you attempt to get out of a room together. Many places close after midnight which gives the gang enough time to meet, eat and escape. Will you work well together or fall apart under the pressure as you try to figure out challenging puzzles and head-scratching clues? Will the bromance stand the trials of an escape room?\\nGo for an after-hours climb.\\nYouve hit a wall at work recently and youre feeling down. What better way to lift your spirits than to literally climb over a wall? Grab your bros and get over that wall together. This fun, full-body workout will leave you and your buddies hanging for more. Most places open till 8pm.\\nTake aim with an air rifle.\\nYou dont have to wait for reservist to go back to the shooting range. Grab a meal together and then head straight to SAFRAs Indoor Air Weapons Range to relive your army days. Stay sharp as a marksman and polish your skills together. Bonus: you and your bros dont have to clean the rifle after use.\\nPick up archery.\\nWant to be an after-hours avenger? As a mere mortal without an indestructible shield, a mighty hammer, or hi-tech armour, a bow and arrow could be your best shot. This old-school traditional sport is perfect for guys who bonded over Lord of the Rings instead of Star Wars. Instead of meeting up to guzzle, head to the range together instead. Many places close late.\\nBounce.\\nLets face it. No matter how old we are, we cant resist jumping onto a trampoline. Bear your desire to bounce to your bros and burn those calories together at the nearest trampoline park. Fair warning: bouncing for an hour is a full body workout. Bros that ache together, stay together.\\nTake flight and freefall.\\nAlways wanted to try sky-diving but have a fear of heights? Do it indoors at iFly Singapores wind tunnel and experience what its like to fall through the air from 12,000 to 3,000 feet. Bro, you jump, I jump!\\nHang in the air and say namaste.\\nnamaste\\nHang in the air and say namaste.\\nYouve tried yoga but it didnt feel challenging or exciting enough.

Cycle. Checked. Hiked and rock climbed.

Before one of your bros suggests booze and binge which could get the gang back into the uncle zone, butt in with these suggestions.\\nGet groomed.\\nBring your bros to the barbershop for a classic hot towel shave to wind down instead. Sit down on a vintage barber chair, shut your eyes and let the barbers work their magic while you and your mates have a good talk about the latest happenings in your life.

       "      <td>By Health Promotion Board in collaboration with Dr. Yvonne Ng, Senior Consultant, Department of Neonatology, National University Hospital.\\nSpit-up is perfectly normal: most babies under 6 months old experience some amount of spit-up. Nevertheless, it is normal for mummies and daddies to get a little anxious each time it happens.\\nNormal baby spit-ups usually happens right after feeding or burping. It looks like the milk that was just fed or it may appear slightly curdled. Spit-ups occur when your baby feeds too quickly and swallows too much air with his milk. It also happens when he overfeeds.\\nYour baby spits up because he is still young, and the junction between the food pipe and stomach needs a bit of time to get tighter. The spit-ups will become less frequent as your baby grows older.\\nRelated: Feeding Your Baby: Breastfeeding\\n\\nWhen to Be Concerned about Spit-Up\\nBring your baby to the doctor immediately in these cases:\\n1. Babys spit-up is green in colour. This may mean that there is a blockage in your babys intestines, which is a serious condition.\\n2. He vomits continuously in large amounts.\\n3. He appears dehydrated (e.g. less urine, dark urine crying without tears, dry mouth).\\n4. He looks unwell and is in distress.\\n5. His tummy is bloated or swollen.\\n6. He has fever, or diarrhoea.\\n\\nRelated: Your Growing Baby\\n\\nTips to Reduce Spit-Up\\nWhile spitting up is perfectly normal for infants, heres what you can do to minimise it from happening.\\n\\n1. Burp your baby after feeding\\nThis helps him expel the air he may have swallowed during his feeds. Hold your baby on your lap, support his head and body with one hand and gently rub or pat his back with your other hand. Do so for a few minutes after feeding. Theres no need to force it: if your baby doesn't burp, he probably just doesnt need to.\\n\\n2. Dont overfeed your baby\\nStop feeding your baby when he shows signs that he is content, such as turning away from the breast or bottle, or feeling sleepy.\\nRemember, spitting up is common and is no cause for concern as long as your baby is eating and growing well.

       "      <td>Not everyone feels energised by the word exercise. If your parents do not have the habit of exercising regularly in their earlier years, getting them to start having an active lifestyle when they are more advanced in age can be doubly hard. They may feel less confident physically or are more wary of injuries and pains.\\n\\nWalking is an Easy Exercise\\nOne exercise which you can encourage your parents to start with is walking.

They can also take short walks of 10 to 30 minutes each time to keep fit.\\nIf you have difficulty nudging your parents to walk or adopt an active lifestyle, here are some ways you can get them on their feet and into active ageing.\\nRelated: 7 Easy Exercises to an Active Lifestyle\\n\\n10 Tips to Get Your Parents Out Walking\\n\\n1.

As you may know, World AIDS Day is not only about learning more about HIV/AIDS; it's also about doing your part to help people living with HIV or AIDS.\\nWhether you're a relative, a friend, a volunteer, or just a helpful person, there are a few things that can be done to foster acceptance for people living with HIV/AIDS.\\nAs you'll see, being informed is one thing, but contributing to stigma, discrimination, and rejection is something else!\\nThat's why we thought it'd be helpful to give you some tips on how best to support the various initiatives for advocacy, empowerment, and education.\\nOh, and remember that support can take many forms, so don't worry if some of these tips may seem too small or too big for you!\\nWhat matters is that you're involved!\\n\\n1. Social Support for People Living with HIV\\nMisinformation on how HIV/AIDS is transmitted may make some people fearful of interacting with them, a situation that may isolate them in their time of need!\\nThe presence of informed, non-judgemental, and reliable support systems has proven successful in helping people lead a normal life.\\nMost importantly, positive social support can contribute to improved living conditions, as stress can affect how the body reacts to treatments.\\n\\n2. Emotional Support\\nWhether they're feeling happy, sad, angry, or just doubtful, some people need to voice their emotions or have someone to listen to them.\\nIf you think you can be helpful and someone living with HIV/AIDS reaches out to you, be that special someone they confide in and talk to.\\nDont be afraid to ask how your friend is feeling! Avoiding the issue is never the answer, especially where health matters are concerned.\\nYour interest and support can help people feel less self-conscious or less embarrassed.\\n\\n3. Support with Treatments\\nAs you know, the medical treatment of HIV/AIDS has been making pretty big strides over the years.\\nHaving open discussions about the medical treatments can help people living with HIV/AIDS to normalise their treatment as part of their daily routine and not feel stigmatised for it.\\nIf you're close to the person and you know he/she is forgetful, figure out how you can help him/her manage medications and medical appointments!\\nSometimes the most helpful thing you can do is keep things simple and practical!\\n\\n4. Empowering Methods\\nOne form of empowerment you can contribute to is education and advocacy.\\nBy educating those around us on HIV/AIDS through formal or informal platforms, this can help to address misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, and reduce stigma towards HIV/AIDS.\\nCreating a supportive environment can be of big help for people living with HIV/AIDS!\\nYou can involve your teachers, parents, and even the community to find out more about the condition, its symptoms, and its prevention.\\nRemember - every little bit counts!   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                What is a Fracture?\\nFractures are breaks, cracks, or chips in a bone. Children commonly sustain limb fractures after trauma e.g. a fall from the monkey bars at the playground, during a soccer game or a road traffic accident. Fractures may occur in any bone of the body but upper limb fractures are the most common.\\n\\nHow Do You Know if Its Fractured?\\nIf your child has a fracture, your child may complain of pain and you may notice swelling at the site of injury. The limb with the fractured bone may also appear swollen or deformed. Your child may have difficulty moving the affected limb. If this is a bone in the lower limbs, your child may have difficulty weight-bearing / standing. Children's bones are often more pliable and they may sustain partial fractures through the bone shaft. These partial fractures are called greenstick fractures and can only be diagnosed with an X-ray.\\nFractures in infants or toddlers can be more difficult to detect. They may cry and not use the affected limb, despite there being no obvious sign of injury.\\nIf you are not sure if your child has sustained a fracture, it is advisable to see a doctor and obtain an X-ray of the affected area. An x-ray is recommended prior to massage or manipulation which can worsen the fracture (e.g. by a Chinese physician or Sinseh).\\nRelated: Children's Hand Conditions And Injuries\\n\\nWhat To Do if You Suspect a Fracture\\nDo not move a child whose injury involves the neck or back, unless he or she is in imminent danger. Movement can cause serious nerve damage. Call 995 for an ambulance. If the child must be moved, the neck and back must be completely immobilised first, ideally with at least one other person assisting you. Keeping the head, neck, and back in alignment, move the child together as a unit.\\nRelated: Preventing Falls for Babies and Toddlers\\nIf you suspect your child has a mild fracture of the arm, wrist or hand, make a sling to support the fractured area:\\n1. Find a large piece of cloth and fold it into the shape of a triangle.\\n2. Gently slide the wide part of the triangle under the injured arm.\\n3. Tie the loose ends around the neck. Make sure the sling is tied tight enough to hold the arm snugly but not so tightly that blood flow is restricted.\\n4. If a bone in the forearm or wrist is fractured, gently support the injured area and place the lower arm on a folded newspaper or magazine padded with a towel or pillow. This creates a splint that immobilises and protects the broken bone.\\n5. Tie the splint around the arm using cloth strips; place the strips on either side of the injured area.\\n6. After securing the splint, make a sling to support the arm.\\n7. See a doctor immediately to check for possible damage to the nerves or blood vessels. Your child may also need a cast of the fractured bone.\\n8. Give your child some pain relief if required (e.g. paracetamol) - please consult your doctor for the right dosage for your child.\\n\\nRead these next:\\n- Ankle conditions\\n- Common Childhood Injuries A Child-Safe Home\\n- The ABCs of Bruising in Children   \n",

Nothing pleasant awaits overweight men - they're more likely to suffer from diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and many other medical conditions.\\nIf you are not keen on being the one in two males that are overweight, next time it is guy's night out and the plan is wings, pizza and beer, flex your persuasion muscles. Suggest to your bros something active instead. You could enthuse about the benefits of exercise\\nand good dietary habits, play the wife card and pin all your healthy motivations on her, or simply say: \"This uncle wants to be a hunkle!\". For those of us who are new to the lingo, an Uncle is the \"horrible result when you lepak\\ntoo much without exercising or watching your diet\" and a Hunkle is \"what you could be when you shape up to a healthier version of your body shape\".\\nWhatever works! What's most important is that you switch some of those greasy bro nights responsible for weight gain for uncle-to-hunkle activities. Pitch your bros to have a go at one of these 30 activities.

Aim for at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week!\\n\\nGet Active Together\\n\\nNight-Time Outdoor Activities\\nNight cycle to Gardens by the Bay.\\nIts Friday night. Skip the drinks. Gather your gear and bros at East Coast and cycle down the entire stretch to Gardens by the Bay.

If the night is still young, hydrate with veggie juice at Satay by the Bay and head towards Marina Bay Sands. Burn off even more calories cycling around the Promontory while enjoying the calm, serene Singapore River nightscape.\\nNight run at Labrador Park.\\nNot into cycling? How about a run at Labrador Park instead? Its much cooler at night which makes running feel a lot easier. Labrador Nature Reserve is one of the four protected nature reserves in Singapore.

There are look-out decks at Berlayer Creek overlooking serene mangroves where you and your bros can cool down after the run.\\nGo for an after-hours group run.\\nRunning is a great way to clock the recommended minimum 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity a week.

Board in collaboration with Dr. Yvonne Ng, Senior Consultant, Department of Neonatology, National University Hospital.\\nSpit-up is perfectly normal: most babies under 6 months old experience some amount of spit-up. Nevertheless, it is normal for mummies and daddies to get a little anxious each time it happens.\\nNormal baby spit-ups usually happens right after feeding or burping. It looks like the milk that was just fed or it may appear slightly curdled. Spit-ups occur when your baby feeds too quickly and swallows too much air with his milk. It also happens when he overfeeds.\\nYour baby spits up because he is still young, and the junction between the food pipe and stomach needs a bit of time to get tighter. The spit-ups will become less frequent as your baby grows older.\\nRelated: Feeding Your Baby: Breastfeeding\\n\\nWhen to Be Concerned about Spit-Up\\nBring your baby to the doctor immediately in these cases:\\n1. Babys spit-up is green in colour. This may mean that there is a blockage in your babys intestines, which is a serious condition.\\n2. He vomits continuously in large amounts.\\n3. He appears dehydrated (e.g. less urine, dark urine crying without tears, dry mouth).\\n4. He looks unwell and is in distress.\\n5. His tummy is bloated or swollen.\\n6. He has fever, or diarrhoea.\\n\\nRelated: Your Growing Baby\\n\\nTips to Reduce Spit-Up\\nWhile spitting up is perfectly normal for infants, heres what you can do to minimise it from happening.\\n\\n1. Burp your baby after feeding\\nThis helps him expel the air he may have swallowed during his feeds. Hold your baby on your lap, support his head and body with one hand and gently rub or pat his back with your other hand. Do so for a few minutes after feeding. Theres no need to force it: if your baby doesn't burp, he probably just doesnt need to.\\n\\n2. Dont overfeed your baby\\nStop feeding your baby when he shows signs that he is content, such as turning away from the breast or bottle, or feeling sleepy.\\nRemember, spitting up is common and is no cause for concern as long as your baby is eating and growing well. Keep up the good work, mummy and daddy!\\n\\nRead these next:\\n- Baby Has Come Home: Dealing with Changes\\n- Baby Up and About Safely\\n- Healthy Start for Your Baby   \n",

feels energised by the word exercise. If your parents do not have the habit of exercising regularly in their earlier years, getting them to start having an active lifestyle when they are more advanced in age can be doubly hard. They may feel less confident physically or are more wary of injuries and pains.\\n\\nWalking is an Easy Exercise\\nOne exercise which you can encourage your parents to start with is walking. Walking is an easy physical activity they can do anywhere around the neighbourhood, in shopping malls or parks, and at any time. They can also take short walks of 10 to 30 minutes each time to keep fit.\\nIf you have difficulty nudging your parents to walk or adopt an active lifestyle, here are some ways you can get them on their feet and into active ageing.\\nRelated: 7 Easy Exercises to an Active Lifestyle\\n\\n10 Tips to Get Your Parents Out Walking\\n\\n1. Grandpa, lets go to the playground!\\nMost grandparents have a soft spot for their grandchildren. Arrange for them to walk the kids between home and school, or let the grandparents bring them to the beach or playground. They get to bond with the grandchildren and increase their level of physical activity in the process.\\nRelated: Granny, Lets Do These Exercises for the Elderly Together\\n\\n2. \"Mum, do you mind helping me run some errands?\\nCreate more opportunities to step out of the house by getting your parents to help run basic household errands, such as making trips to the post office, florist shops or picking up some groceries. Stepping out of the house helps increase opportunities for physical activity.\\nRelated: Step Up and Enjoy the Benefits of Brisk Walking\\n\\n3. Look, you can plant your own vegetables!\\nCommunity gardens and farms have sprung up around HDB precincts and in some condominiums. There are even creative farmers planting herbs and vegetables along HDB corridors. You can encourage your parents to do some gardening which involves tending to plants daily and walking more often. Gardening is a wonderful physical activity for active ageing. Moving around the garden, squatting, shovelling, pulling weeds, raking - these repetitive motions of gardening work your heart rate and can improve your flexibility and muscle health over time.\\nRelated: Harness the Goodness of Fruit and Vegetables\\n\\n4. Lets go to the market!\\nMaking a trip to the market can be an effective way to get moving. Instead of driving to do the groceries, consider bringing along a trolley to help ease the load as you take a walk home from the market.\\nRelated: How To Get Fit Fast At Home: Play Video Games!\\n\\n5. This course looks interesting!\\nEncourage your parents to refresh their hobbies or pick up new ones as part of active ageing. To help them overcome the inertia, you can help them source and sign up for courses. Having a structured programme to attend means making regular trips and moving more on those days. Adding activity is one way to get your parents to have a more active lifestyle.\\nRelated: 4 Ways to Stay Fit Without a Gym Membership\\n\\n6. Time for a family outing!\\nAsk the grandparents along on field trips when you bring your kids to the zoo, parks or museums. The activities and sights at each venue translate into a good walk and increased physical activity for everyone. Alternatively, help them sign up for walking tours organised by community centres or Residents Committees which bring them around Singapores places of interest.\\nRelated: Building Strong Family Ties\\n\\n7. Happy birthday, Dad! Heres your annual membership card!\\nIf you buy gifts for your parents, think of how your presents can lead to new experiences and a higher physical activity level. How about getting your parents memberships to places of interest such as Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa or the Jurong Bird Park to encourage them to have a more active lifestyle? With more time on their hands, they are more likely to make full use of these cards (dont waste!) and get that much-needed exercise.\\nRelated: Sleep well, live better\\n\\n8. Look, this organisations looking for volunteers!\\nFind an organisation and cause that matches the interests and values of your folks and encourage them to sign up as volunteers. For example, they can read stories to children at public libraries, help out at animal shelters or be guides at museums. Theres bound to be an area where they can contribute, keep fit and stay active at the same time.\\nRelated: Being a Helping Hand\\n\\n9. \"Do you know there is an interest group in our neighbourhood?\\nKeep a lookout for activity groups organised by community clubs, Residents Committees or exercise groups in neighbourhood parks and beaches. If you see a Taiji group practising at the beach or a brisk walking crowd at the park, just ask any of its members for information. You can also encourage them to sign up for HPBs free community physical activity classes here\\n! \\n 10. Grandma, do you mind taking the puppy for a walk?\\nIf your elderly folks are pet lovers, spending time with animals is also a great way to lead an active lifestyle. For example, both granny and doggie can get their needed strolls together or go on pet events such as picnics or carnivals.\\nRelated: Active Ageing: Rewire After You Retire\\n\\nWalk for Fun, Family and Fulfilment\\nIf your parents prefer a sedentary lifestyle at home, give them more reasons to put on their walking shoes beyond the word exercise. They are more likely to do so for fun, family, and fulfilment. You just have to take time to find out what works.\\n\\nRead these next:\\n- 4 Fitness Motivation Hacks for Friends\\n- 5 Exercises to Prevent Chronic Illnesses\\n- Active Ageing: Rewire After You Retire   \n",
